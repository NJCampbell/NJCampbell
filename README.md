  <h4>About me: </h4>
<p>I am a Full Stack Developer hailing from the woodland realm of Florida. 🌳 </p>
<p>I absolutely love the feeling I get from building a project and seeing it all come together. Having spent many years creating art in a variety of styles and mediums, I now use programming as my paintbrush to color the world. A lifelong learner, I like to delve into a plethora of subjects and expand my knowledge, some of those topics include:
  <ul>
    <li>Space and our ever-expanding cosmos</li>
    <li>New and upcoming hardware and technology</li>
    <li>Nature and the web of interconnectedness we share</li>
    <li>Neurodivergence and the unique gifts that accompany it</li>
  </ul>
  I enjoy spending my free time playing video games, reading and spending time with my dog, Fox Mulder. 🐕 </p>
